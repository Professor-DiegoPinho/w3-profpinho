# JavaScript Introduction

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript was initially created to "make web pages alive". The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

## Example

Here's a simple JavaScript example:

```javascript
// This is a comment
let message = "Hello, World!";
console.log(message);

function greetUser(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

console.log(greetUser("Diego"));
```

## Key Features

- **Dynamic typing**: Variables can hold different types of values
- **Interpreted language**: No need to compile before running
- **Event-driven**: Responds to user interactions
- **Object-oriented**: Supports objects and classes
