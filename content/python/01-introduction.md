# Python Introduction

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

## What is Python used for?

- Web development (server-side)
- Software development
- Mathematics
- System scripting
- Data analysis
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning

## Python Syntax

Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line or by creating a python file.

### Example

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

# Variables
name = "Diego"
age = 25
is_programmer = True

print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

# Function
def greet_user(username):
    return f"Welcome, {username}!"

print(greet_user("Python Learner"))
```

## Python Features

- **Easy to learn**: Simple and readable syntax
- **Interpreted**: No need to compile
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux
- **Large standard library**: Batteries included
- **Dynamic typing**: Variables don't need type declaration

## Getting Started

To start learning Python, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: python.org

### Your First Python Program

```python
print("Welcome to Python learning!")

# Variables and data types
message = "Learning Python is fun!"
number = 42
is_learning = True

print(message)
print(f"The answer is {number}")
print(f"Are you learning? {is_learning}")
```

## What's Next?

In the following chapters, you will learn:

1. Python syntax and indentation
2. Variables and data types
3. Operators and expressions
4. Control structures (if, for, while)
5. Functions and modules
6. Object-oriented programming
